The `break` and `continue` keywords in Dart are used to control the flow of loops.

**break**

The `break` keyword is used to exit a loop immediately. When you encounter a `break` statement in a loop, the loop will terminate immediately and the program will continue execution after the loop.

For example, the following code will print the numbers from 1 to 10 to the console, but it will stop when the number 5 is reached:

```dart
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  if (i == 5) {
    break;
  }
  print(i);
}
```

**continue**

The `continue` keyword is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. When you encounter a `continue` statement in a loop, the rest of the current iteration is skipped and the loop immediately starts the next iteration.

For example, the following code will print the even numbers from 1 to 10 to the console:

```dart
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  if (i % 2 != 0) {
    continue;
  }
  print(i);
}
```

**When to use `break` and `continue`**

* `break`: Use `break` to exit a loop early, when you have reached a specific condition.
* `continue`: Use `continue` to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration.

**Conclusion**

The `break` and `continue` keywords are powerful tools for controlling the flow of loops in Dart. By understanding how to use these keywords, you can write Dart code that is more concise, efficient, and maintainable.
