In Dart, the `break` and `continue` keywords are used to control the flow of loops, such as `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops. Here's an explanation of how these keywords work:

1. **Break:**
   - The `break` statement is used to exit a loop prematurely, before it reaches its normal termination condition.
   - When a `break` statement is encountered within a loop, the loop is immediately terminated, and program control moves to the statement following the loop.

   Example:
   ```dart
   for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
     if (i == 3) {
       break; // Exit the loop when i is 3
     }
     print('Iteration $i');
   }
   ```

   In this example, the loop will terminate when `i` becomes 3, and the program will move to the next statement after the loop.

2. **Continue:**
   - The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration.
   - When a `continue` statement is encountered within a loop, the remaining code within the current iteration is skipped, and the loop proceeds to the next iteration.

   Example:
   ```dart
   for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
     if (i == 2) {
       continue; // Skip iteration when i is 2
     }
     print('Iteration $i');
   }
   ```

   In this example, the loop will skip the iteration when `i` is 2, so "Iteration 2" will not be printed.

Both `break` and `continue` statements are used to modify the normal control flow of loops and are handy for handling specific conditions or implementing complex logic within loops. Use them judiciously to achieve the desired loop behavior.
