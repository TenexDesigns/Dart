Exception handling in Dart is used to handle errors that may occur during the execution of a program.

There are four keywords used for exception handling in Dart:

* `try`: The `try` block is used to enclose the code that may throw an exception.
* `catch`: The `catch` block is used to handle the exception that is thrown by the code in the `try` block.
* `on`: The `on` clause is used to specify the type of exception that the `catch` block will handle.
* `finally`: The `finally` block is always executed, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not.

Here is a simple example of how to use exception handling in Dart:

```dart
try {
  // Code that may throw an exception
} catch (e) {
  // Handle the exception
} finally {
  // Code that is always executed
}
```

You can also use multiple `catch` blocks to handle different types of exceptions. For example, the following code shows how to handle `ArithmeticException` and `RangeError` exceptions:

```dart
try {
  // Code that may throw an exception
} catch (e) {
  if (e is ArithmeticException) {
    // Handle ArithmeticException
  } else if (e is RangeError) {
    // Handle RangeError
  } else {
    // Handle other types of exceptions
  }
} finally {
  // Code that is always executed
}
```

The `finally` block is used to clean up any resources that were used in the `try` block, even if an exception is thrown. For example, the following code shows how to close a file, regardless of whether an exception is thrown:

```dart
try {
  // Open a file
  // Write to the file
} catch (e) {
  // Handle the exception
} finally {
  // Close the file
}
```

Here are some examples of where to use exception handling in Dart:

* When reading a file, in case the file does not exist or cannot be read.
* When writing to a file, in case the file cannot be written to.
* When connecting to a database, in case the database is unavailable.
* When parsing a JSON object, in case the JSON object is not valid.
* When performing any other operation that may fail.

**Conclusion**

Exception handling is an important part of writing robust and reliable Dart code. By understanding how to use exception handling, you can write Dart code that is more resilient to errors.
