In Dart, you can define custom exceptions by creating your own exception classes that extend the built-in `Exception` class or any other exception class. Here's how you can define and handle custom exceptions in Dart:

**Step 1: Create a Custom Exception Class**

You can create a custom exception class by extending the `Exception` class or any other exception class that makes sense for your application. Here's an example of creating a custom exception called `MyCustomException`:

```dart
class MyCustomException implements Exception {
  final String message;

  MyCustomException(this.message);

  @override
  String toString() {
    return 'MyCustomException: $message';
  }
}
```

In this example, `MyCustomException` extends the built-in `Exception` class and takes a `message` parameter that describes the exception.

**Step 2: Throw the Custom Exception**

You can throw your custom exception using the `throw` keyword. For example:

```dart
void someFunction() {
  // Some condition that triggers the custom exception
  if (someConditionIsMet) {
    throw MyCustomException('This is a custom exception.');
  }
}
```

In this example, if `someConditionIsMet` evaluates to `true`, it will throw the `MyCustomException` with the specified message.

**Step 3: Handle the Custom Exception**

To handle your custom exception, you can use a `try` and `catch` block, just like you would with built-in exceptions:

```dart
try {
  someFunction();
} catch (e) {
  if (e is MyCustomException) {
    print('Custom exception caught: ${e.message}');
    // Handle the custom exception
  } else {
    // Handle other exceptions
    print('An error occurred: $e');
  }
}
```

In this example, we catch the `MyCustomException` specifically and handle it. If any other exception occurs, it will be caught by the generic `catch` block.

By creating and using custom exceptions, you can make your code more expressive and handle specific error scenarios in a clean and organized way.
