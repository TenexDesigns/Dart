Dart does not have a dedicated `interface` keyword like some other programming languages (e.g., Java or C#). Instead, Dart achieves similar functionality through the use of abstract classes and class inheritance. In Dart, you can create an abstract class that defines a set of methods that must be implemented by concrete classes. These abstract classes serve as interfaces.

Here's how you can define and use an "interface" in Dart:

```dart
// Define an abstract class as an "interface"
abstract class MyInterface {
  void doSomething();
  int calculate(int a, int b);
}

// Create a concrete class that implements the "interface"
class MyImplementation implements MyInterface {
  @override
  void doSomething() {
    print('Doing something...');
  }

  @override
  int calculate(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
  }
}

void main() {
  final obj = MyImplementation();
  obj.doSomething();
  final result = obj.calculate(5, 3);
  print('Result: $result');
}
```

In the example above:

1. We define an abstract class called `MyInterface`. This abstract class declares two abstract methods, `doSomething()` and `calculate()`. These methods serve as the "interface" that concrete classes must implement.

2. We create a concrete class called `MyImplementation` that implements `MyInterface`. This means that `MyImplementation` must provide concrete implementations for both `doSomething()` and `calculate()`.

3. In the `main` function, we create an instance of `MyImplementation`, and we can call the methods declared in the "interface."

Dart's approach to interfaces using abstract classes is flexible and allows classes to implement multiple "interfaces" (abstract classes). This provides similar functionality to traditional interfaces found in other languages.
