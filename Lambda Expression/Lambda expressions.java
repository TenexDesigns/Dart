Dart lambda expressions are a short and concise way to represent functions. They are also known as anonymous functions or closures. Lambda expressions are functions without a name that can be used inline within the code.

Lambda expressions are defined using the `=>` arrow operator. The left-hand side of the arrow operator is the parameter list for the function, and the right-hand side of the arrow operator is the body of the function.

For example, the following code shows how to define a lambda expression that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their sum:

```dart
(int a, int b) => a + b;
```

This lambda expression can be used inline within the code, as shown in the following example:

```dart
int sum = (10, 20) => 10 + 20;
```

This code snippet will assign the value 30 to the `sum` variable.

Lambda expressions can also be used to pass functions as parameters to other functions. For example, the following code shows how to pass a lambda expression to the `sort()` method:

```dart
List<int> numbers = [5, 3, 2, 1, 4];

numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b);

print(numbers); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

This code snippet will sort the `numbers` list in ascending order, using the lambda expression to compare the elements of the list.

Lambda expressions are a powerful tool that can be used to write more concise and readable code. By understanding how to use lambda expressions in Dart, you can write more robust and reliable code.

Here are some other examples of lambda expressions in Dart:

```dart
// Lambda expression that takes no parameters and returns the string "Hello, world!"
() => "Hello, world!";

// Lambda expression that takes a string parameter and returns the length of the string
(String str) => str.length;

// Lambda expression that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of the numbers
(List<int> numbers) => numbers.fold(0, (sum, element) => sum + element);
```

Lambda expressions can be used in a variety of situations, such as:

* To pass functions as parameters to other functions.
* To create inline functions that are used only once.
* To implement callbacks.
* To create closures.

Lambda expressions are a powerful tool that can help you write more concise, readable, and efficient code.
