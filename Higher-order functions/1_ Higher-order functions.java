Higher-order functions in Dart are functions that take functions as parameters or return functions as results. Lambda expressions are anonymous functions that can be used inline within the code.

Here is an example of a higher-order function in Dart:

```dart
// A higher-order function that takes a function as a parameter and returns a new function
Function<T> map<T>(Function<T> f) {
  return (List<T> list) {
    List<T> newList = [];
    for (var item in list) {
      newList.add(f(item));
    }
    return newList;
  };
}
```

This function takes a function as a parameter and returns a new function that applies the passed-in function to each element of a list.

Here is an example of how to use the `map()` function:

```dart
List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Apply the `double()` function to each element of the `numbers` list
List<int> doubledNumbers = map((int number) => number * 2)(numbers);

print(doubledNumbers); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

Lambda expressions can be used to pass functions as parameters to higher-order functions. For example, the following code snippet shows how to use a lambda expression to pass a function to the `map()` function:

```dart
List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Apply the `(int number) => number * 2` function to each element of the `numbers` list
List<int> doubledNumbers = map((int number) => number * 2)(numbers);

print(doubledNumbers); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

Higher-order functions and lambda expressions are powerful tools that can help you write more concise, readable, and efficient code. By understanding how to use higher-order functions and lambda expressions in Dart, you can write more robust and reliable code.

Here are some other examples of higher-order functions in Dart:

* `filter()`: This function takes a function as a parameter and returns a list containing only the elements of the original list that satisfy the passed-in function.
* `reduce()`: This function takes a function and an initial value as parameters and returns a single value by applying the passed-in function to each element of the list and accumulating the results.
* `sort()`: This function takes a function as a parameter and sorts the elements of the list in ascending order using the passed-in function to compare the elements.

Higher-order functions and lambda expressions can be used in a variety of situations, such as:

* To implement data processing algorithms.
* To create reusable code that can be used for different purposes.
* To write more concise and readable code.
* To implement callbacks.

Higher-order functions and lambda expressions are an important part of functional programming. By understanding how to use higher-order functions and lambda expressions in Dart, you can write more elegant and efficient code.
