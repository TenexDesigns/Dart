The `late` keyword in Dart is used to delay the initialization of a variable until it's actually used. This can be useful when the variable's initializer isn't available at the time of its declaration, or to avoid unnecessary initialization for performance reasons.

Here's an example of how to use the `late` keyword:

```dart
class MyClass {
  late String name;

  void setName(String newName) {
    name = newName;
  }

  String getName() {
    return name;
  }
}

void main() {
  var myObject = MyClass();
  myObject.setName('John Doe');
  print(myObject.getName());  // Prints: John Doe
}
```

In this example, the `name` variable is declared as `late`, which means it doesn't need to be initialized at the time of declaration. It's only initialized when the `setName` method is called.

The `late` keyword is different from the `final` keyword. The `final` keyword is used when you want a variable to be set once and then never changed. Once a `final` variable has a value, it can't be changed. This is useful for declaring constants or values that shouldn't change once they're set.

Here's an example of how to use the `final` keyword:

```dart
class MyClass {
  final String name;

  MyClass(this.name);
}

void main() {
  var myObject = MyClass('John Doe');
  print(myObject.name);  // Prints: John Doe
}
```

In this example, the `name` variable is declared as `final`, which means it can only be set once, and it can't be changed after it's set.

So, to summarize:

- Use `late` when you want to delay the initialization of a variable until it's actually used.
- Use `final` when you want a variable to be set once and then never changed.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
