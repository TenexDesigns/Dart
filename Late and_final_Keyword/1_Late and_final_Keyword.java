In Dart, the `late` keyword is used to declare a non-nullable variable that will be initialized at some point in the future. It allows you to delay the initialization of a variable until after the constructor has completed, which can be useful in situations where you cannot provide an initial value at the time of declaration, but you guarantee that it will be initialized before you try to access it.

Here's how `late` works and when and why you might use it:

1. **How `late` Works**:
   - A `late` variable must be of a non-nullable type.
   - It doesn't require an initial value at the time of declaration.
   - You must ensure that the variable is initialized before you access it, or you'll get a runtime error (a `LateInitializationError`).

2. **When to Use `late`**:
   - When you need a non-nullable variable but can't provide an initial value at the point of declaration.
   - In scenarios where you can guarantee the variable will be initialized before it's accessed, such as in a constructor or an initialization method.

3. **Code Samples**:

   ```dart
   class Example {
     late String _name; // Declaring a late variable of non-nullable String type.
   
     Example(String initialName) {
       // Assigning a value to the late variable in the constructor.
       _name = initialName;
     }
   
     void initializeName(String newName) {
       // You can also initialize a late variable in a method.
       _name = newName;
     }
   
     void printName() {
       // Accessing the late variable is safe because it's guaranteed to be initialized.
       print(_name);
     }
   }
   ```

   In the above example, `_name` is declared as a `late` variable and initialized within the constructor and a custom method. This usage of `late` is safe because you ensure its initialization within the class.

Now, let's compare `late` with `final`:

- `late` is used when you need a non-nullable variable that will be initialized after declaration. You guarantee that it will be initialized before use.

- `final` is used when you need an immutable variable that must be initialized at the point of declaration and cannot be changed afterward. It's ideal for values that should not change during the object's lifetime.

In summary, you'd use `late` when you need a non-nullable variable that is guaranteed to be initialized at some point after its declaration, whereas `final` is used when you have a variable that should not change after initialization. Your choice between `late` and `final` depends on the specific requirements of your code and the guarantees you can provide regarding initialization.
