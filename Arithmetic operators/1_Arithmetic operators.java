Dart supports various arithmetic operators that allow you to perform mathematical operations on numbers. Here are the common arithmetic operators in Dart, along with code samples:

1. **Addition (+):**
   The `+` operator is used for addition.

   ```dart
   int a = 5;
   int b = 3;
   int sum = a + b;
   print('Sum: $sum'); // Output: Sum: 8
   ```

2. **Subtraction (-):**
   The `-` operator is used for subtraction.

   ```dart
   int a = 10;
   int b = 7;
   int difference = a - b;
   print('Difference: $difference'); // Output: Difference: 3
   ```

3. **Multiplication (*):**
   The `*` operator is used for multiplication.

   ```dart
   int a = 4;
   int b = 6;
   int product = a * b;
   print('Product: $product'); // Output: Product: 24
   ```

4. **Division (/):**
   The `/` operator is used for division. If both operands are integers, the result is a double.

   ```dart
   int dividend = 10;
   int divisor = 3;
   double result = dividend / divisor;
   print('Result: $result'); // Output: Result: 3.3333333333333335
   ```

5. **Integer Division (~/):**
   The `~/` operator performs integer division, returning only the integer part of the division result, discarding the remainder.

   ```dart
   int dividend = 10;
   int divisor = 3;
   int quotient = dividend ~/ divisor;
   print('Quotient: $quotient'); // Output: Quotient: 3
   ```

6. **Modulus (%):**
   The `%` operator calculates the remainder of the division.

   ```dart
   int dividend = 10;
   int divisor = 3;
   int remainder = dividend % divisor;
   print('Remainder: $remainder'); // Output: Remainder: 1
   ```

7. **Increment (++) and Decrement (--):**
   The `++` operator is used to increment a variable by 1, and the `--` operator is used to decrement a variable by 1.

   ```dart
   int count = 5;
   count++; // Increment count by 1
   print('Count: $count'); // Output: Count: 6

   count--; // Decrement count by 1
   print('Count: $count'); // Output: Count: 5
   ```

These are the basic arithmetic operators in Dart. You can use these operators to perform various mathematical calculations in your Dart programs.
