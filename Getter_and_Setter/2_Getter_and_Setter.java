Getters and setters in Dart are special methods that allow you to read and write the values of an object's properties.

**Getters** are used to read the values of an object's properties. They are defined using the `get` keyword and do not take any parameters. For example, the following code shows how to define a getter for the `name` property of a `Person` class:

```dart
class Person {
  String name;

  get name => this.name;
}
```

To read the value of the `name` property, you would simply use the dot notation. For example, the following code shows how to read the value of the `name` property of the `person` object:

```dart
Person person = new Person();
person.name = "Alice";

String name = person.name;
```

**Setters** are used to write the values of an object's properties. They are defined using the `set` keyword and take one parameter. The parameter is the new value of the property. For example, the following code shows how to define a setter for the `name` property of a `Person` class:

```dart
class Person {
  String name;

  set name(String newName) {
    this.name = newName;
  }
}
```

To write the value of the `name` property, you would use the dot notation and the assignment operator. For example, the following code shows how to write the value of the `name` property of the `person` object:

```dart
Person person = new Person();

person.name = "Alice";
```

Getters and setters are a powerful way to control the access to an object's properties. By using getters and setters, you can ensure that the values of an object's properties are always valid and that they are only changed in a controlled manner.

Here are some examples of how getters and setters can be used:

* To validate the parameters passed to a setter. For example, you could use a setter to validate that the age of a `Person` object is greater than zero.
* To perform complex operations when a property is read or written. For example, you could use a getter to format the value of a property before it is returned to the caller.
* To implement lazy loading. For example, you could use a getter to load the value of a property from a database only when the property is first read.

Getters and setters are an important part of object-oriented programming. By understanding how to use getters and setters in Dart, you can write more robust and reliable code.
