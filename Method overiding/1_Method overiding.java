Method overriding in Dart allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. When a subclass overrides a method, it provides its own version of the method with the same name and parameters.

Here's an example of method overriding in Dart:

```dart
class Animal {
  void makeSound() {
    print('Animal makes a sound');
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  @override
  void makeSound() {
    print('Dog barks');
  }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
  @override
  void makeSound() {
    print('Cat meows');
  }
}

void main() {
  final dog = Dog();
  final cat = Cat();

  dog.makeSound(); // Calls Dog's makeSound
  cat.makeSound(); // Calls Cat's makeSound
}
```

In this example:

- We have a superclass `Animal` with a method `makeSound`.
- We create two subclasses, `Dog` and `Cat`, that inherit from `Animal`.
- Both `Dog` and `Cat` override the `makeSound` method to provide their own implementations.
- In the `main` function, we create instances of `Dog` and `Cat` and call the `makeSound` method on them.

The output will be:

```
Dog barks
Cat meows
```

As you can see, the `makeSound` method in each subclass provides a specific implementation. This is known as method overriding. When you call `makeSound` on an instance of `Dog`, it calls the overridden `makeSound` method in the `Dog` class, and the same applies to `Cat`.

Method overriding is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming, allowing you to provide specialized behavior in subclasses while maintaining a common interface defined in the superclass. The `@override` annotation is used to indicate that a method is intended to override a superclass method, helping catch errors if the method signatures do not match.
