Method overriding in Dart is a mechanism that allows you to override the methods of a parent class in a child class. This allows you to customize the behavior of a method for a specific type of object.

To override a method, you simply define a method with the same name and signature (return type and parameter types) as the method in the parent class. The overridden method will be called when the method is called on an object of the child class.

For example, the following code shows how to override the `greet()` method in the `Student` class:

```dart
class Person {
  String name;
  int age;

  Person(this.name, this.age);

  void greet() {
    print("Hello, my name is $name and I am $age years old.");
  }
}

class Student extends Person {
  String major;

  Student(this.name, this.age, this.major);

  @override
  void greet() {
    print("Hello, my name is $name and I am a $major student at $age years old.");
  }
}
```

When you call the `greet()` method on a `Student` object, the overridden `greet()` method in the `Student` class will be called.

Method overriding is a powerful tool that allows you to customize the behavior of methods for specific types of objects. By understanding how to use method overriding in Dart, you can write more flexible and reusable code.

Here are some other examples of method overriding in Dart:

* A `Car` class could override the `drive()` method of a `Vehicle` class to implement the specific driving behavior of a car.
* A `Dog` class could override the `bark()` method of an `Animal` class to implement the specific barking behavior of a dog.
* A `SavingsAccount` class could override the `withdraw()` method of a `BankAccount` class to implement the specific withdrawal rules for savings accounts.

Method overriding is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming. By understanding how to use method overriding in Dart, you can write more robust and reliable code.
