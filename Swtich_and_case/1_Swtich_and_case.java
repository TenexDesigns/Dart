The switch statement in Dart is a conditional statement that allows you to execute different code blocks based on the value of an expression.

The syntax for the switch statement is as follows:

switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // code to be executed if the expression evaluates to value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // code to be executed if the expression evaluates to value2
    break;
  ...
  default:
    // code to be executed if the expression does not evaluate to any of the case values
}
The expression can be of any type, but it is typically an integer, enum, or string. The case values must be of the same type as the expression.

For example, the following code will print a different message to the console depending on the value of the variable dayOfWeek:

Dart
int dayOfWeek = 1;

switch (dayOfWeek) {
  case 1:
    print("Monday");
    break;
  case 2:
    print("Tuesday");
    break;
  case 3:
    print("Wednesday");
    break;
  case 4:
    print("Thursday");
    break;
  case 5:
    print("Friday");
    break;
  case 6:
    print("Saturday");
    break;
  case 7:
    print("Sunday");
    break;
  default:
    print("Invalid day of week.");
    break;
}

Nested switch statements

You can also nest switch statements to create more complex conditional statements. For example, the following code will print a different message to the console depending on the value of the variables dayOfWeek and isNight:

Dart
int dayOfWeek = 1;
bool isNight = false;

switch (dayOfWeek) {
  case 1:
    if (!isNight) {
      print("Monday morning.");
    } else {
      print("Monday night.");
    }
    break;
  case 2:
    if (!isNight) {
      print("Tuesday morning.");
    } else {
      print("Tuesday night.");
    }
    break;
  ...
  default:
    print("Invalid day of week.");
    break;
}
