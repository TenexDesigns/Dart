An abstract class in Dart is a class that cannot be instantiated directly, but must be extended by other classes. Abstract classes are used to define the common structure and behavior of a set of related classes.

Abstract classes can contain both abstract and concrete methods. Abstract methods are methods that do not have an implementation. They must be implemented by the subclasses of the abstract class.

To define an abstract class, you use the `abstract` keyword. For example, the following code shows how to define an abstract class called `Animal`:

```dart
abstract class Animal {
  String name;

  Animal(this.name);

  // Abstract method
  void makeSound();
}
```

The `makeSound()` method is an abstract method because it does not have an implementation. It must be implemented by the subclasses of the `Animal` class.

To extend an abstract class, you use the `extends` keyword. For example, the following code shows how to extend the `Animal` class to create a `Dog` class:

```dart
class Dog extends Animal {
  Dog(String name) : super(name);

  @override
  void makeSound() {
    print("Woof!");
  }
}
```

The `Dog` class overrides the `makeSound()` method of the `Animal` class to implement the specific barking sound of a dog.

To create an object of a subclass of an abstract class, you simply use the `new` keyword. For example, the following code shows how to create a `Dog` object:

```dart
Dog dog = new Dog("Fido");
```

Once you have created an object of a subclass of an abstract class, you can call the concrete methods of the subclass and the abstract methods of the parent class. For example, the following code shows how to call the `makeSound()` method on the `dog` object:

```dart
dog.makeSound(); // Prints "Woof!"
```

Abstract classes are a powerful tool for organizing your code and making it more reusable. By using abstract classes, you can define the common structure and behavior of a set of related classes, and then implement the specific details of each class in a subclass.

Here are some other examples of abstract classes in Dart:

* `Vehicle`: This class could define the common properties and methods of all vehicles, such as `make`, `model`, and `drive()`.
* `BankAccount`: This class could define the common properties and methods of all bank accounts, such as `balance` and `withdraw()`.
* `Shape`: This class could define the common properties and methods of all shapes, such as `area` and `perimeter()`.

Abstract classes are a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming. By understanding how to use abstract classes in Dart, you can write more robust and reliable code.
