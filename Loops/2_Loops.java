Loops and iterators are used to repeat a block of code until a certain condition is met. Dart has three types of loops:

For loop: The for loop is used to iterate over a fixed number of times.
While loop: The while loop is used to iterate over a block of code as long as a condition is true.
Do-while loop: The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it will always execute the code block at least once, even if the condition is false.
For loop

The for loop has the following syntax:

Dart
for (initializer; condition; increment) {
  // code block to be executed
}
Use code with caution. Learn more
The initializer is executed once before the loop starts. The condition is checked before each iteration of the loop. If the condition is true, the code block is executed. After the code block is executed, the increment is executed. The loop continues to iterate as long as the condition is true.

For example, the following code will print the numbers from 1 to 10 to the console:

Dart
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  print(i);
}

While loop

The while loop has the following syntax:

Dart
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
Use code with caution. Learn more
The condition is checked before each iteration of the loop. If the condition is true, the code block is executed. The loop continues to iterate as long as the condition is true.

For example, the following code will print the numbers from 1 to 10 to the console, but it will only stop when the user enters the number 10:

Dart
int number = 1;

while (number != 10) {
  print(number);
  number++;
}

Do-while loop

The do-while loop has the following syntax:

Dart
do {
  // code block to be executed
} while (condition);
Use code with caution. Learn more
The code block is executed at least once. Then, the condition is checked. If the condition is true, the loop iterates. The loop continues to iterate as long as the condition is true.

For example, the following code will print the numbers from 1 to 10 to the console, even if the user enters the number 10:

Dart
int number = 1;

do {
  print(number);
  number++;
} while (number != 10);

Iterators

Iterators are used to traverse a collection of data. Dart has a number of built-in iterators, such as the ListIterator and the MapIterator. You can also create your own custom iterators.

To use an iterator, you first need to create an instance of the iterator. Then, you can call the next() method to get the next element in the collection. The next() method will return null when there are no more elements in the collection.

For example, the following code uses a ListIterator to iterate over a list of numbers:

Dart
List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

ListIterator<int> iterator = numbers.iterator;

while (iterator.hasNext()) {
  int number = iterator.next();
  print(number);
}
Use code with caution. Learn more
When to use each type of loop

For loop: The for loop is the best choice when you know the exact number of times you want to iterate over a block of code.
While loop: The while loop is the best choice when you don't know how many times you want to iterate over a block of code, but you know when you want to stop iterating.
Do-while loop: The do-while loop is the best choice when you want to iterate over a block of code at least once, even if the condition is false.
Conclusion

Loops and iterators are powerful tools for writing Dart code. By understanding how to use loops and iterators, you can write Dart code that is more concise, efficient, and maintainable.
