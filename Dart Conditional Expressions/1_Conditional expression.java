The ternary operator, also known as the conditional expression, is a shorthand way of writing an `if-else` statement. It takes the following form:

```
<condition> ? <value_if_true> : <value_if_false>
```

The `condition` is a boolean expression. If the condition evaluates to `true`, the expression will return the value of `<value_if_true>`. Otherwise, the expression will return the value of `<value_if_false>`.

For example, the following code is equivalent:

```
int age = 18;

// if-else statement
if (age < 18) {
  print("You are not old enough to vote.");
} else {
  print("You are old enough to vote.");
}

// ternary operator
String message = age < 18 ? "You are not old enough to vote." : "You are old enough to vote.";

print(message);
```

The `??` operator, also known as the null-safe logical OR operator, is used to return the value of its first operand if it is not null, otherwise it returns the value of its second operand.

For example, the following code will print the value of the variable `name` to the console if it is not null, otherwise it will print the string "Unknown":

```
String? name = "John Doe";

// if-else statement
if (name != null) {
  print(name);
} else {
  print("Unknown");
}

// ?? operator
String message = name ?? "Unknown";

print(message);
```

**Benefits of using the ternary operator and the ?? operator**

Using the ternary operator and the ?? operator has a number of benefits, including:

* It makes your code more concise and readable.
* It can improve the performance of your code.
* It can make your code more robust by preventing null pointer exceptions.

**Conclusion**

The ternary operator and the ?? operator are powerful tools for writing concise, readable, and robust Dart code. By understanding how to use these operators, you can improve the quality of your code.
