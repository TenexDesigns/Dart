In Dart, you can use conditional expressions to write concise conditional statements that return values based on a condition. Dart supports two main types of conditional expressions: the ternary conditional operator (also known as the ternary operator) and the `??` (null-aware) operator.

1. **Ternary Conditional Operator**:

The ternary conditional operator is used to evaluate a condition and return one of two expressions based on whether the condition is true or false. Its syntax is as follows:

```dart
condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse
```

- If `condition` is true, `expressionIfTrue` is evaluated and returned.
- If `condition` is false, `expressionIfFalse` is evaluated and returned.

Here's an example:

```dart
int number = 10;
String result = (number > 5) ? 'Greater than 5' : 'Less than or equal to 5';
print(result); // Output: Greater than 5
```

In this example, the condition `number > 5` is true, so `'Greater than 5'` is returned.

2. **Null-aware (??) Operator**:

The null-aware operator, `??`, is used to provide a default value when a value is `null`. It allows you to handle null values more gracefully. Its syntax is as follows:

```dart
expression1 ?? expression2
```

- If `expression1` is not `null`, it is returned.
- If `expression1` is `null`, `expression2` is returned as a fallback.

Here's an example:

```dart
String name;
String displayName = name ?? 'Guest';
print(displayName); // Output: Guest
```

In this example, the variable `name` is `null`, so `'Guest'` is returned as the default value.

You can also chain the null-aware operator to provide multiple fallbacks:

```dart
String name;
String displayName = name ?? 'Guest' ?? 'Unknown';
print(displayName); // Output: Guest
```

In this case, if `name` is `null`, it falls back to `'Guest'`, and if `'Guest'` were also `null`, it would fall back to `'Unknown'`.

Conditional expressions, especially the null-aware operator, are useful for handling cases where you need to provide default values or make decisions based on the presence or absence of values. They help make your code more concise and readable.
