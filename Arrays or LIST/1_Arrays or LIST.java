In Dart, you can work with lists, which are dynamic and can change in size during runtime. Lists in Dart can be divided into two main categories: fixed-length lists and growable lists. Let's explore both types and their methods:

### Fixed-Length List:

A fixed-length list in Dart has a specified size that cannot be changed once it's created. You can use a `List` constructor with a fixed length to create such lists.

```dart
void main() {
  // Creating a fixed-length list with 3 elements
  List<int> fixedList = List<int>(3);

  // Inserting elements into the fixed-length list
  fixedList[0] = 10;
  fixedList[1] = 20;
  fixedList[2] = 30;

  // Accessing elements
  print(fixedList[0]); // Output: 10

  // This will throw an error because the list size is fixed
  // fixedList.add(40);
}
```

In the example above, we create a fixed-length list with a size of 3, and we insert elements at specific indices.

### Growable List:

A growable list in Dart can change in size dynamically. You can use the `List` constructor without specifying a fixed length to create a growable list.

```dart
void main() {
  // Creating a growable list
  List<int> growableList = [];

  // Inserting elements into the growable list
  growableList.add(10);
  growableList.add(20);
  growableList.add(30);

  // Accessing elements
  print(growableList[1]); // Output: 20

  // Adding more elements
  growableList.add(40);
  print(growableList[3]); // Output: 40
}
```

In the example above, we create a growable list initially empty and then add elements to it using the `add` method. Growable lists can grow or shrink as needed.

### List Methods:

Here are some common methods available for working with lists in Dart:

- `add`: Adds an element to the end of the list.
- `addAll`: Adds all elements from another iterable to the end of the list.
- `insert`: Inserts an element at a specified index.
- `remove`: Removes the first occurrence of a specified element.
- `removeAt`: Removes the element at a specified index.
- `removeLast`: Removes and returns the last element.
- `clear`: Removes all elements from the list.
- `length`: Returns the number of elements in the list.

Here's an example of using some of these methods with a growable list:

```dart
void main() {
  List<String> fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];

  // Add an element to the end
  fruits.add('date');

  // Insert an element at a specific index
  fruits.insert(1, 'grape');

  // Remove an element
  fruits.remove('banana');

  // Get the number of elements
  print('Number of fruits: ${fruits.length}');

  // Print all elements using iteration
  for (var fruit in fruits) {
    print(fruit);
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a list of fruits, add, insert, and remove elements, get the length, and iterate through the list to print its contents. The list is growable, so you can modify it as needed.
