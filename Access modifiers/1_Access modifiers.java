In Dart (and, by extension, Flutter), access modifiers control the visibility of variables, functions, classes, and other members. Dart provides three main access modifiers:

1. **Public:** By default, members are public. They can be accessed from anywhere within the same library, package, or application.

2. **Private:** Dart provides a way to make members private by prefixing their names with an underscore `_`. Private members are only accessible within the library they are defined in. For example, if you have a private variable `_myVariable`, it can only be accessed within the same Dart library.

3. **Protected:** Dart does not have a protected access modifier like some other programming languages. Members that are intended to be protected are usually prefixed with an underscore to indicate that they should not be accessed from outside the library or class, but this is a convention rather than a strict access control.

Here's an example:

```dart
class MyClass {
  String publicVariable = 'I am public'; // Public variable

  String _privateVariable = 'I am private'; // Private variable

  String getPrivateVariable() {
    return _privateVariable; // Accessible within the same library
  }

  String protectedMethod() {
    return 'I am protected'; // No strict protection; use conventions
  }
}
```

In the example above:

- `publicVariable` is a public variable and can be accessed from anywhere.
- `_privateVariable` is a private variable and should only be accessed within the same library.
- `getPrivateVariable()` is a method that provides access to `_privateVariable`.

Dart relies on naming conventions and underscores to indicate the intended visibility of members. While there is no strict "protected" modifier, developers often use an underscore to indicate that a member should not be accessed from outside the library or class.

Flutter follows the same Dart language conventions for access modifiers, so you can use `_` to make members private within your Flutter code as well.
