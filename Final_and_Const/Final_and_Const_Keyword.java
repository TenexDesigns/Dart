The `final` and `const` keywords in Dart are used to define constants. Constants are values that cannot be changed after they are initialized.

**Differences between `final` and `const`**

* `final` variables can be initialized at runtime, while `const` variables must be initialized at compile time.
* `final` variables can be modified if they are mutable objects, while `const` variables cannot be modified.

**Uses of `final` and `const`**

* `final` is typically used to define variables that should not be changed, but whose values are not known at compile time. For example, you might use `final` to define a variable that represents the current date and time.
* `const` is typically used to define variables whose values are known at compile time and that should not be changed. For example, you might use `const` to define a variable that represents the number of days in a year.

Here are some examples of how to use `final` and `const`:

```dart
// final variable
final String myName = "John Doe";

// const variable
const int daysInAYear = 365;

// mutable object
final List<String> myList = ["one", "two", "three"];

// immutable object
const String myString = "This is a constant string.";
```

**Benefits of using `final` and `const`**

Using `final` and `const` to define constants has a number of benefits, including:

* It makes your code more readable and maintainable.
* It helps to prevent errors.
* It can improve the performance of your code.

**Conclusion**

The `final` and `const` keywords in Dart are a powerful tool for creating and using constants. By understanding how to use `final` and `const`, you can write Dart code that is more robust, efficient, and maintainable.
