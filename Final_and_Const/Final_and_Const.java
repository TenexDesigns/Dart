In Dart, you can define constants using the `final` and `const` keywords. While both are used to create variables that cannot be modified after their initial assignment, there are key differences between them:

1. **`final` Keyword:**
   - Variables declared with `final` are initialized only once and can be assigned a value at runtime.
   - They are evaluated when they are first used.
   - `final` variables are more flexible than `const` because they can have different values based on runtime conditions.
   - `final` variables can be initialized with values calculated at runtime or set in constructors.

   Example:
   ```dart
   final int finalVariable = 42;
   final String greeting;

   finalVariable = 10; // Error: Cannot assign to final 'finalVariable' more than once.

   if (someCondition) {
     greeting = 'Hello, World!';
   } else {
     greeting = 'Hi, Dart!';
   }
   ```

2. **`const` Keyword:**
   - Variables declared with `const` are compile-time constants, meaning their values must be known at compile time.
   - They are evaluated and initialized at compile time, which makes them more efficient and suitable for constant values.
   - `const` variables must be initialized with constant expressions, literals, or the result of other `const` expressions.

   Example:
   ```dart
   const int constVariable = 42;
   const String language = 'Dart';

   constVariable = 10; // Error: Constant variables can't be assigned a value.

   const String greeting = 'Hello, $language!'; // Error: Interpolation is not a constant expression.
   ```

**Key Differences:**
- `final` variables are evaluated at runtime, while `const` variables are evaluated at compile time.
- `final` variables can have different values based on runtime conditions, but `const` variables must have constant values.
- You can use `final` for values that are determined at runtime, such as the result of a function call or a value set in a constructor. `const` is typically used for true constants like mathematical constants or configuration values known at compile time.
- `const` variables are implicitly `final`, so if you know a value is constant at compile time, it's better to use `const` for efficiency.

In summary, use `final` when you need a variable that is initialized once but can have different values at runtime. Use `const` for values that are known and can be evaluated at compile time to take advantage of their efficiency and optimization benefits.
