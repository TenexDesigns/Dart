In Dart, like many other programming languages, you can work with various data types to store and manipulate different kinds of values. Here are some common data types in Dart:

1. **Numbers:**
   - `int`: Represents integers (whole numbers) like 1, 42, -10.
   - `double`: Represents floating-point numbers (numbers with decimal points) like 3.14, -0.5.

   Example:
   ```dart
   int age = 30;
   double price = 12.99;
   ```

2. **Strings:**
   - `String`: Represents sequences of characters, enclosed in single (' ') or double (" ") quotes.

   Example:
   ```dart
   String name = 'John';
   String greeting = "Hello, World!";
   ```

3. **Booleans:**
   - `bool`: Represents a Boolean value, either `true` or `false`.

   Example:
   ```dart
   bool isRaining = true;
   bool isSunny = false;
   ```

4. **Lists:**
   - `List`: Represents a collection of objects, which can be of different types, and is ordered and indexed. Lists can be defined using square brackets `[]`.

   Example:
   ```dart
   List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   List<String> fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
   ```

5. **Maps:**
   - `Map`: Represents a collection of key-value pairs, where keys are unique. Maps can be defined using curly braces `{}`.

   Example:
   ```dart
   Map<String, int> scores = {
     'Alice': 95,
     'Bob': 88,
     'Charlie': 72,
   };
   ```

6. **Dynamic:**
   - `dynamic`: Represents a type that can change at runtime. It can hold values of any data type.

   Example:
   ```dart
   dynamic x = 42;
   x = 'Hello, Dart!';
   ```

7. **Null:**
   - `null`: Represents the absence of a value. Variables can be assigned the value `null`.

   Example:
   ```dart
   String? nullableString = null;
   ```

8. **Object:**
   - `Object`: The root type of the Dart type hierarchy. All types are subtype of `Object`.

   Example:
   ```dart
   Object obj = 'Some value';
   ```

9. **Functions:**
   - `Function`: Represents a function type, which can be used to define function variables.

   Example:
   ```dart
   int add(int a, int b) {
     return a + b;
   }
   ```

These are the fundamental data types in Dart. You can create variables of these types to store and manipulate data in your Dart programs. Dart also supports type inference, which means you can omit the type annotation, and Dart will automatically determine the type based on the assigned value. For example:

```dart
var age = 30; // Dart infers that age is an int.
var name = 'John'; // Dart infers that name is a String.
```

Dart provides a rich set of libraries and tools for working with these data types, making it a versatile language for various application types.
