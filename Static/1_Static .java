The `static` keyword in Dart is used to declare class-level variables and methods. Class-level variables are shared by all instances of the class, and class-level methods can be called without creating an instance of the class.

**Static variables**

Static variables are declared using the `static` keyword followed by the variable name. 
  For example, the following code shows how to declare a static variable in a `Person` class:

```dart
class Person {
  static int count = 0;

  Person() {
    count++;
  }

  static int getCount() {
    return count;
  }
}
```

The `count` variable is a static variable because it is declared with the `static` keyword. This means that all instances of the `Person` class will share the same `count` variable.

To access a static variable, you use the class name followed by the variable name. For example, the following code shows how to access the `count` variable:

```dart
int personCount = Person.count;
```

You can also call static methods on a class without creating an instance of the class. For example, the following code shows how to call the `getCount()` method on the `Person` class:

```dart
int personCount = Person.getCount();
```

**Static methods**

Static methods are declared using the `static` keyword followed by the method name. For example, the following code shows how to declare a static method in a `Person` class:

```dart
class Person {
  static int getCount() {
    return count;
  }
}
```

The `getCount()` method is a static method because it is declared with the `static` keyword. This means that you can call the `getCount()` method without creating an instance of the `Person` class.

To call a static method, you use the class name followed by the method name. For example, the following code shows how to call the `getCount()` method:

```dart
int personCount = Person.getCount();
```

**Uses of static variables and methods**

Static variables and methods are useful for a variety of purposes, such as:

* Storing global data that is shared by all instances of a class.
* Implementing utility methods that can be used without creating an instance of a class.
* Providing a way to access class-level data and methods without having to create an instance of the class.

Here are some examples of how to use static variables and methods in Dart:

* **Storing global data:** You could use a static variable to store the current user's logged-in status.
* **Implementing utility methods:** You could use a static method to generate a random number.
* **Providing a way to access class-level data and methods:** You could use a static method to get the total number of people who have created instances of a `Person` class.

Static variables and methods are a powerful tool for writing reusable and efficient code. By understanding how to use static variables and methods in Dart, you can write more robust and reliable code.
